## Reproducible research on the paper [Reliable Beamspace Channel Estimation for Millimeter-Wave Massive MIMO Systems with Lens Antenna Array](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7959626)

Run 'Fig6_main_OMP_vs_SMD_vs_SD.m' to get the fig.6 of the paper.


Run 'Fig7_main_Q_OMP_vs_SD.m' to get the fig.7 of the paper.


Original code is from [here](http://oa.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/dailinglong/publications/code/Reliable%20beamspace%20channel%20estimation%20for%20millimeter-wave%20massive%20MIMO%20systems%20with%20lens%20antenna%20array.zip), but it seems not completed and lack the main algorithm.


Please enjoy.
